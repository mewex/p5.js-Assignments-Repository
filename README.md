README for p5.js Assignments Repository
Overview
This repository contains a series of p5.js assignments focused on creating various interactive and dynamic visual elements. Each assignment is designed to progressively introduce concepts of programming in p5.js, emphasizing the manipulation of shapes and their properties in response to user inputs and programmed conditions.

Assignments List
A1-01: Draw three lines.
A1-02: Draw five lines.
A1-03: Draw three ellipses.
A1-04: Control the position of two lines with one variable.
A1-05: Control the position and size of two lines with two variables.
A1-06: Control the properties of two shapes with two variables.
A1-07: Create a simple, regular pattern with six lines.
A1-08: Program your pattern from A1-07 using while().
A1-09: Draw a layered form with two new loops. Layers can include shapes on top of each other, nested shapes, or background/foreground layers.
A1-10: Redo A1-05 using mouseX and mouseY as the variables.
A1-11: Draw two visual elements that each move in relation to the mouse in a different way.
A1-12: Draw three visual elements that each move in relation to the mouse in a different way.
A1-13: Move a visual element across the screen. When it disappears off the edge, move it back into the frame.
A1-14: Draw a visual element that moves in relation to the mouse, but with a different relation when the mouse is pressed.
A1-15: Using if and else, make the mouse perform different actions when in different parts of the window.
A1-16: Develop a kinetic image which responds to the mouse.
Installation
